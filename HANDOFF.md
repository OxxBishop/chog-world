Read `TASKS.md` first.

## Project in one paragraph

Chog World is a Chogathon 2026 entry: a shared 3D island world where your Chog NFT comes alive, learns
you, and goes grey and wanders off as an NPC when you sell it (`docs/` and the concept doc have the full
idea). Three.js + Vite, deployed on Vercel at https://chog-world.vercel.app. On-chain parts run on
**Monad testnet** (chain 10143) against a testnet copy of Chog Genesis, so sign-in, ownership and the sale
are real but free.

## Facts every agent needs

- **Testnet Chog contract:** `0x85a9ba85e5a3e87bab529c402140a87a72622b91`. ABI in `tools/chain/build/ChogTestnet.json`; how it works is in `tools/chain/README.md`.
  - Token ids 1 to 1969 match mainnet Chog Genesis.
  - `claim(id)`, `claimRandom()` (3 per wallet), `tokensOf(address)`, standard `Transfer` events.
- **Trait data:** `public/data/chogs.json` (every token's traits and art) and `public/meta/<id>.json` (tokenURI files). Regenerate them with `tools/traits/`.
- **Performance:** the user's laptop has an Intel HD 520. Test with `?q=low` and read `?debug` for fps, draw calls and toggles. Judges will have faster machines, but it must stay usable on that laptop.
- **3D Chogs:** the user makes them in Tripo and auto-rigs them there. C preps each one and drops it into `public/models/`. Don't hand-model or repaint Chogs in code; the user rejected that look.
- **Rules:**
  - Bot Crossing is a reference for cosy feel only. Never copy its assets, signs or name.
  - CC0 assets only (KayKit, Kenney).
  - Commits authored as OxxBishop, no trailers.
  - Public copy: no em dashes.

## Log

### 2026-10-13 · C
- Added `TASKS.md` and this file. Agent A was already partway through A1 and A5 when the board started.
- Testnet contract deployed and tested on-chain: claim, transfer with its `Transfer` event, `claimRandom`, and the 3-per-wallet limit.
- First Tripo model (a singing Chog) came without a rig: the export had no skeleton, and the stage disc and mic stand are fused into the mesh. The user is re-exporting it with the rig, without the stage, and holding just the mic. When it arrives it goes to `public/models/` for A5.
